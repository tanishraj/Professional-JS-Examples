    <h2>Manipulating Windows</h2>
    <p>The window object is useful to manipulate browsers windows (and frames), which means as a developer,
        you are able to move the resize browser windows.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>moveBy(dx, dy): </strong> moves the browser window dx pixels horizontally and dy pixels
        vertically relative to its current position. Negative Numbers can be used for dx to move the window to the left
        and for dy to move window up.</li>
        <li><strong>moveTo(x, y): </strong> moves the browser window so that its upper left corner is located at position
        (x,y) on the user's screen. Negative numbers can be used, but these move part of window off the screen visible.</li>
        <li><strong>resizeBy(dw, dh): </strong> resizes the browser window's width by dw pixels and its height by dh
            pixels relative to the window's current size. Negative numbers can be used for dw to shrink the windows's width
        and for dh to shrink the windows's height.</li>
        <li><strong>resizeTo(w, h):</strong> resizes the browser windows width to w and its height to h. Negative numbers can
        not be used.</li>
    </ul>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        //move the window right by 10 pixels and down by 20 pixels
        window.moveBy(10,20);

        //resize the window to have a width of 150 and a height of 300
        window.resizeTo(150, 300);

        //resize the window to be 150px wider, but leave the height alone
        window.resizeBy(150, 0);

        //move back to the upper left corner of the screen
        window.moveTo(0,0);
    </script>
