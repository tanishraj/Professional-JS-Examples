    <p>It is possible to access the history of a browser window. The history is the list of places the user has been.
    For security reasons, all you can do to navigate through the history; there is no way to get the URLs of the pages contained
    in the browser history.</p>

    <a href="14. HistoryDemo.html">Click me to go to another page</a>

    <p><button onclick="goForward()">Click me to go forward</button></p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        function goForward() {
            //below code can be written without window object reference
            window.history.go(1);

            //below code can be written as well in place of above code
            history.forward();
