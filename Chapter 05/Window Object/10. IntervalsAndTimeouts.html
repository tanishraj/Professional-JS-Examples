    <h2>Interval And Timeouts</h2>
    <p>Java developers are familiar with wait() method of object, which causes the program to stop and wait a
    a specified amount of time before continuing on to the next line of code. This is very useful piece of functionality
    and unfortunately, one that JS does not support.</p>
    <p>JS supports timeouts and intervals, which effectively tells the browser when certain code should be executed.
    Timeouts execute the given code after a specified number of milliseconds. Interval executes given code repeatedly, waiting a
    specified number of milliseconds in between.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        function sayHello() {
            alert("Hello, Tanish!!");
        }

        setTimeout(sayHello, 5000);
    </script>
