    <h2>External File Format</h2>
    <p>External JS files have a very simple format. Essentially, they are just plain
    text file containing JS code. No script tags are needed inside of external files,
    because the script tags referencing the files in present in HTML page. This makes external
    JS files look very similar to source code files for other programming language.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript" src="script/external.js"></script>
