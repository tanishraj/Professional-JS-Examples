    <h2>Tag Placement</h2>
    <p>Generally speaking, it is common to place all code and function definitions in the head
    tag of an HTML page so that the code is fully loaded and ready for use once the body is rendered.
    The only code that should appear with in the body tag is code that calls the functions defined
    previously.</p>

    <p>When the script tag is placed inside of the body tag, the script is executed as soon as as the part
    of the page is downloaded to the browser. This makes it possible to execute JS code before the entire
    page is loaded.</p>
