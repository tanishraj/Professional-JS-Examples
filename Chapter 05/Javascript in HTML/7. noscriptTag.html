    <h2>noscript Tag</h2>
    <p>Another concern over browsers without JS is how to provide alternate content.
    Hiding the code was part of solution, but developers wanted a way to specify
    content that should appear only if JS was not available.</p>

    <p>The solution came in from of the noscript tag, that can contain any HTML code aside script code.
    This HTML code is ignored by the browser that support JS and have it enabled, any browser that does not
    support JS and have it disabled renders the content of no script tag.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        document.write("<p style='color: aquamarine;'>Hello there, This browser supports JS.</p>")
    </script>
    <noscript>
        <p style="color : #f00">Hello there, Really sorry to say that your browser does not support JS.</p>
    </noscript>
</body>
