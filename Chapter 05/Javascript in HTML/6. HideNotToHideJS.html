    <h2>To Hide Or Not To Hide JS</h2>
    <p>When JS was first introduced, only one browser supported it, so concern arose ober how the non supporting browsers
    would deal with the script tag and the code contained within it. To that end, a format was devised to hide code from older
    browsers (which is a phrase that can still be found in the source code of a great many websites on the internet today)
    The following method uses HTML comments around inline code so that other browsers wont render the code to the screen.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        <!-- Hide From Older Browser
            function sayHi() {
                alert("Hi");
            }

            sayHi();
        //-->
    </script>
</body>
