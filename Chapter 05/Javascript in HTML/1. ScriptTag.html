    <h2>Script Tag</h2>
    <p>Javascript is included in HTML pages by using the script tag. Typically located within the
    head tag of the page, the script tag was originally defined to have one or two attributes.
    language that indicates the scripting language being used and, optionally, src that indicates
    an external javascript file to include in the page. The language attribute is traditionally set
    to javascript but it can also be used to indicate exact version of javascript, such as javascript1.</p>
