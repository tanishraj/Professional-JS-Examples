    <h2>Inline Code Vs External Files</h2>
    <p>When should you write the code inline versus writing the code in external file?
        Although no hard and fast rules exist about when to use either method, the general
        consensus is that large amounts of JS should never be included inline for number of reasons.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Security: </strong> Anyone can see exactly what the code is doing just by
        viewing the source of the page. If a malicious developer examines the code, he might find
        security holes that could compromise the site or application.</li>
        <li><strong>Code Maintenance </strong> If JS code is sprinkled through out various pages,
        code maintenance. It is much easier to have a directory for all JS files so that when JS error
        occurs, there is no question about where the code is located.</li>
        <li><strong>Cachig: </strong> Browsers cache all externally linked JS files according
        to specific setting, meaning that if two pages are using the same file, it is only downloaded once.
        This is ultimately faster loading time.</li>
