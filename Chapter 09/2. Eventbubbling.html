    <h2>Even Flow</h2>
    <p>Both the development teams for Internet Explorer 4.0 and Netscape Navigator 4.0 decided that supporting
        events was not enough, so each came up with its own form of event flow. Event flow means that more
        than one element on the page can respond to the same event. What happens when you click a button on
        the page? In reality, you are clicking the button, its container, and the page as a whole. Logically, each of
        the elements should be able to respond to that event in a specific order. The order of events (the event
        flow) is the main difference between event support in IE 4.0 and Netscape 4.0.</p>

    <h2>Event Bubbling</h2>
    <p>For Internet Explorer, the solution was answered by a technique dubbed bubbling. The basic idea of event
        bubbling is that the event fires sequentially from the most specific event target to the least specific (the
        document object).</p>
