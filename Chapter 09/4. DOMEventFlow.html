    <h2>DOM Event Flow</h2>
    <p>The DOM supports both event capturing and event bubbling, but event capturing occurs first. Both
        event flows hit all the objects in the DOM, beginning and ending with the document object</p>

    <p>A unique feature of the DOM event model is that text nodes fire events as well (this is not so in Internet
        Explorer).</p>
