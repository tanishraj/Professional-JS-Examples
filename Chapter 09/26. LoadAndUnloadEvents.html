    <h2>Load And Unload Events</h2>
    <p>The load event is probably used most often because DOM manipulation canâ€™t take place until the entire
        page has been loaded. Two methods define an onload event handler for a window.</p>

    <p><strong>Notes: </strong> The problem here is that the load event actually happens on the window, which is why the
        event handler is defined on the window object using JavaScript. In HTML, however, there is no code representation
        of the window object, so the HTML gurus decided that the handler should be assigned on
        the <body/> element and then placed on the window object behind the scenes. So, if you set the onload
    event handler on the <body/> element and then check the window.onload property,</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        //
        window.onload = function () {
            alert("Window Loaded.");
        }
    </script>
</body>
