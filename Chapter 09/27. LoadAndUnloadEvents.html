    <h2>Load And Unload Events</h2>
    <p>Can you still assign an event handler to document.body.onload? Yes, you can. The problem is that
        document.body doesnâ€™t exist until the page has loaded the body tag. This means that if you try to
    assign the event handler in the head element, where it should be done, you get an error. Try it for
    yourself:</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        document.body.onload = function(){
            alert("Loaded.");
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
