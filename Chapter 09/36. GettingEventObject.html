    <h2>Getting the event object</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, IE and the DOM use very different methods to get the event object. In IE, the event
        object is tied to the window object although in the DOM it is independent of any other object and is
        passed in as an argument. Because of this, it is very difficult to make IE’s event model act like Mozilla’s,
        or vice versa. Instead of trying to make one like the other, you can create a new method that can be used
        by both browsers called getEvent().</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        EventUtil.getEvent = function() {
            if (window.event) {
                return this.formatEvent(window.event);
            } else {
                return EventUtil.getEvent.caller.arguments[0];
            }
        };
    </script>
