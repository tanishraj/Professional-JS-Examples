    <h2>Event Handlers/Listeners</h2>
    <p>Events are certain actions performed either by the user or by the browser itself. These events have names
        like click, load, and mouseover. A function that is called in response to an event is called an event handler (or,
        as the DOM describes it, an event listener). A function responding to a click event is considered an onclick
        event handler. Traditionally, event handlers are assigned in one of two ways: in JavaScript or in HTML.</p>

    <div id="div1">Click Me</div>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        //Below written function is a heavy code which will be created to
        var oDiv = document.getElementById("div1");
        oDiv.onclick = function () {
            alert("I was clicked.");
        }
    </script>
