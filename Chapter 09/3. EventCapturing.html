    <h2>Event Capturing</h2>
    <p>While Internet Explorer 4.0 used event bubbling, Netscape Navigator 4.0 used an alternate solution
        called event capturing. Event capturing is just the opposite of bubbling; events fire from the least-specific
        object (the document object) to the most specific (it was also possible to capture events at the window
        level, but that has to be specified explicitly by the developer). Netscape Navigator also doesnâ€™t expose
        many elements on the page to events.</p>
    <p>Some have also called this the top-down event model because it works from the top of the DOM hierarchy
        to the bottom</p>
