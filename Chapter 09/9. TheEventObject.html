    <h2>The Event Object</h2>
    <p>Developers for both browsers knew that it was important to pass information about an event to the
        developer. The result was to create an event object that contained information specific to the event that
        had just occurred such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The object that caused the event</li>
        <li>Information about the mouse at the time of the event</li>
        <li>Information about the keyboard at the time of the event</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Event objects are only created when an event occurs and are made accessible to the event handlers. After
        all event handlers have been executed, the event object is destroyed.</p>
