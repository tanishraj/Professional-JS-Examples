    <h2>The EventUtil object</h2>
    <p>Whenever you are planning on creating multiple functions that are used in the same task, it’s always
        best to create a container object to manage them. Doing so makes it easy to figure out where the function
        is defined when debugging.</p>

    <p>In this case, the EventUtil object is the container for all the event-related functions defined in this section.
        Because there are no properties and you only need one instance of this object, there’s no need to
        define a class:</p>

    <p><strong>Example: </strong> <br/> var EventUtil = new Object;</p>
