    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>JavaScript’s interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or browser
        manipulates a page. When the page loads, that’s an event. When the user clicks a button, that
        click, too, is an event. Developers can use these events to execute coded responses, which cause
        buttons to close windows, messages to be displayed to users, data to be validated, and virtually
        any other type of response imaginable to occur.</p>
