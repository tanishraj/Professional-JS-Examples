    <h2>Types of Events</h2>
    <p>The events that occur in a browser can be grouped into several specific types, depending on the object
        the event is fired from and what triggered the event to fire. The DOM specification defines the following
        event groups:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mouse Events are fired when the user uses the mouse to perform certain actions.</li>
        <li>Keyboard Events are fired when the user types on the keyboard.</li>
        <li>HTML Events are fired when certain changes occur to the browser window or specific client server
            interaction occurs.</li>
        <li>Mutation Events are fired when a change occurs to the underlying DOM structure.</li>
    </ul>
