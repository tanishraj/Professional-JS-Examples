    <h2>Mutation events</h2>
    <p>Mutation events, although part of the DOM standard, have yet to be implemented in any major browser.
        As such, the following information is intended to provide a brief look into what the standard defines
        and not to discuss how these events might be used.</p>

    <p>The mutation events include the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>DOMSubtreeModified — </strong> fires when the subtree of a document or element is modified by
            either adding or removing nodes</li>
        <li><strong>DOMNodeInserted —</strong>  fires when a node is inserted as a child of another node</li>
        <li><strong>DOMNodeRemoved — </strong> fires when a node is removed as a child of another node</li>
        <li><strong>DOMNodeRemovedFromDocument — </strong> fires when a node is removed from a document</li>
        <li><strong>DOMNodeInsertedIntoDocument — </strong> fires when a new node is inserted into a document</li>
    </ul>
