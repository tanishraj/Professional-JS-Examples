    <h2>Cross-Browser Events</h2>
    <p>Up until this point, you have seen many different types of browser and feature detection used in each
        example. In actual code, you want to try to minimize the number of times you use such detection in the
        main section of code. To achieve this, most developers come up with a cross-browser approach to events
        so that all the browser and feature detection is done behind the scenes. This section guides you through
        the creation of such an approach.</p>

    <p>The purpose of the cross-browser code in this section is to equalize, as much as possible, the differences
        between the IE event model and the DOM event model, allowing one set of code to run across all major
        browsers almost identically. Of course, some limitations exist, such as IEâ€™s lack of support for bi-directional
        event flow, but it is still possible to cover 80 to 90% of all cases.</p>
