    <h2>Sequencing</h2>
    <p>When the user presses a character key once, the following sequence of events occurs:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>keydown</li>
        <li>keypress</li>
        <li>keyup</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If the user presses a non-character key once, such as Shift, the following event sequence takes place:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>keydown</li>
        <li>keyup</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Note: </strong> If the user presses a character key and holds it down, keydown and keypress are fired repeatedly, one
        after the other, until the key is released; if the user presses and holds down a non-character key, only the
        keydown event fires repeatedly.</p>
