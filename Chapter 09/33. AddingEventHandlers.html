    <h2>Adding Event Handlers</h2>
    <p>As you saw earlier, IE uses the attachEvent() method to assign any number of event handlers to an
        element, whereas the DOM uses addEventListener(). The first method of the EventUtil object creates
        a common way to assign event handlers and is called addEventHandler() (so as not to be confused
        with either browser’s implementation). This method accepts three arguments: the object to assign
        the event handler to, the name of the event to handle, and the function to assign. Because IE doesn’t support
        event capturing, this method assigns event handlers during bubbling only. Inside the body of the
        method is a simple detection algorithm designed to use the correct functionality at the correct time:</p>

        <div id="button">Click Me</div>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var EventUtil = new Object;
        EventUtil.addEventHandler = function (oTarget, sEventType, fnHandler) {
            if (oTarget.addEventListener) {
                //for DOM-compliant browsers
                oTarget.addEventListener(sEventType, fnHandler, false);
            }
            else if (oTarget.attachEvent) {
                //for IE
                oTarget.attachEvent("on" + sEventType, fnHandler);
            }
            else {
                //for all others
                oTarget["on" + sEventType] = fnHandler;
            }
        };

        var messageAlert = function(){
            alert("Hello how are you?");
        }

        var oButton = document.getElementById("button");
        EventUtil.addEventHandler(oButton, "click", messageAlert);
    </script>
