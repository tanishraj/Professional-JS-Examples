    <h2>Getting Key Code</h2>
    <p>During a keydown or keyup event, you can retrieve the code for the key that was pressed by using the
        keyCode property:</p>
    <p>var iKeyCode = oEvent.keyCode;</p>
    <p>The keyCode property always contains a code the represents the key pressed, which may or may not
        represent a character. For example, the Enter (or Return) key has a keyCode of 13, the space bar has a
        keyCode of 32, and the BackSpace key has a keyCode of 8.</p>

    <input type="text" id="div1"/>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var oDiv = document.getElementById("div1");

        function handleEvent(oEvent) {
            alert(oEvent.keyCode);
        }

        oDiv.onkeyup = handleEvent;
    </script>
