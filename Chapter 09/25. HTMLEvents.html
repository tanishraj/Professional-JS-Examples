    <h2>HTML Events</h2>
    <p>The HTML events group makes up a large number of the remaining events from the original event
        model created by developers of IE 4.0 and Netscape 4.0. It includes the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>The load event, which fires on a window when the page has been completely loaded, on a
            frameset when all frames have been completely loaded, on an img tag element when it has been
            completely loaded, or on an object element when it has been completely loaded.</li>

        <li>The unload event, which fires on a window when the page has been completely unloaded, on a
            frameset when all frames have been completely unloaded, or on an object element when it
            has been completely unloaded.</li>

        <li>The abort event, which fires on an object element if it is not fully loaded before the user
            stops the download process.</li>

        <li>The error event, which fires on a window when a JavaScript error occurs, on an img element
            if the image specified cannot be loaded, on an object element if it cannot be loaded,
            or on frameset if one or more frames cannot be loaded. This event is discussed in Chapter 14,
            “Error Handling.”</li>

        <li>The select event, which fires when the user selects one or more characters in a text box (either
            input or textarea). This event is discussed further in Chapter 11, “Forms and Data
            Integrity.”</li>

        <li>The change event, which fires on a text box (either input or textarea) when it loses
            focus and the value has changed since the textbox got focus, and on a select element when
            its value is changed.</li>

        <li>The submit event, which fires on a form when a Submit button (input type=”submit”)
            is clicked.</li>

        <li>The reset event, which fires on a form when a Reset button (input type=”reset”) is
            clicked.</li>

        <li>The resize event, which fires on a window or frame when it is resized.</li>

        <li>The scroll event, which fires on any element with a scrollbar when the user scrolls it. The
            body element contains the scrollbar for a loaded page.</li>

        <li>The focus event, which fires on any element or on the window itself when it gets focus (the user
            clicks on it, tabs to it, or otherwise interacts with it).</li>

        <li>The blur event, which fires on any element or on the window itself when it loses focus.</li>
    </ul>
