    <h2>Dealing with attributes</h2>
    <p>Only element node have attributes even though the node interface has an attributes method that is
    inherited by all node types.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>getNameItem(name): </strong> returns the node whose nodeName property is equal to name.</li>
        <li><strong>removeNameItem(name): removes the node whose node name property is equal to name from the list.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>setNameItem(name): </strong> adds the node into the list, indexing it by its nodeName property.</li>
        <li><strong>item(pos): </strong> just like nodeList, returns the node in the numerical position.</li>
    </ul>
