    <h2>Accessing Specific Nodes</h2>
    <p>You already know how to access parent and child nodes, but what if you want to access to a node
    or group of nodes that are located deep in the document. Certainly, you don't want to count child nodes

    methods to enable easy access to specific nodes.</p>
