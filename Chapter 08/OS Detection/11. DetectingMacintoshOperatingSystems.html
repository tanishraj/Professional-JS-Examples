    <h2>Detecting Macintosh operating systems</h2>
    <p>Believe it or not, this is actually an easy part of the trek into the client’s machine. Traditionally, Macintosh
        browsers would not tell you the operating system being used; the only information they provided was
        whether the Macintosh was using a 68000 processor or a PowerPC processor. Only recently have browsers
        begun to report the MacOS X as the operating system, meaning that testing for MacOS X is trustworthy
        if you find “MacOS X” in the user-agent string. If it’s not there, however, the user could still be using
        MacOS X but not have a browser that reports it. For this reason, it’s best to stick to the old method of
        checking the processor.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var isMac68K = isMacPPC = false;

        if (isMac) {
            isMac68K = sUserAgent.indexOf("Mac_68000") > -1
                || sUserAgent.indexOf("68K") > -1;
            isMacPPC = sUserAgent.indexOf("Mac_PowerPC") > -1
                || sUserAgent.indexOf("PPC") > -1;
        }
