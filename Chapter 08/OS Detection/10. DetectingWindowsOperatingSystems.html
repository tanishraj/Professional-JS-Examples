    <h2>Detecting Windows operating systems</h2>
    <p>It seems like every other year a new version of the Windows operating system is released. For a long
        time, Microsoft has had two separate versions of Windows: one for home use and one for business use.
        The home use version was called simply called Windows. The business version was called Windows NT.
        Little overlap occurred between the two versions. The one exception, however, was the user interface. In
        2001, Microsoft decided to merge the home and business versions into a new product, Windows XP. This
        new operating system combines the stability and security of Windows NT with the user-friendliness of
        traditional Windows.</p>
