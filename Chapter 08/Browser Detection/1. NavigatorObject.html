    <h2>Navigator Object</h2>
    <p>The most important object in client-side browser detection is the navigator object. The navigator
    object is one of the earliest BOM objects implemented (beginning in Netscape Navigator 2.0
    and Internet Explorer 3.0). As I mentioned in Chapter 5, “JavaScript in the Browser,” it contains a
    number of properties that can give you information about the browser, such as the name, version,
    and platform.</p>

    <p><strong>Note: </strong> Although Microsoft objected to the term navigator as being specific to Netscape’s browser, the
    navigator object has become a sort of de facto standard for providing information about a Web
    browser. (Microsoft does have its own object called clientInformation in addition to the
    navigator object, but they both provide similar data.)</p>
