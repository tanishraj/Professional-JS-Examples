    <h2>Object/Feature Detection</h2>
    <p>Object detection (also called feature detection) is a generic way of determining a browser’s capabilities
    rather than the exact make and model of a target browser. Most JavaScript experts point to this method
    as the most appropriate one to use because they believe it future proofs scripts against changes that might
    make it difficult to determine the exact browser being used.</p>

    <p id="SecondPara">Object detection involves checking to see if a given object exists before using it. For instance, suppose
    you want to use the DOM method document.getElementById(), but you aren’t sure if the browser
    supports it.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        if(document.getElementById){
            document.write("<p style='color: green; font-weight: 700;'>YAY! your browser support this method.</p>");
        }
        else{
            document.write("<p style='color: red; font-weight: 700;'>Sorry, your browser does not support this method.</p>");
        }
    </script>
