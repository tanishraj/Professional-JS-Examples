    <h2>User-agent string detection</h2>
    <p>User-agent string detection is the oldest browser detection method there is. Every program that accesses
    a Web site is required to provide a user-agent string identifying itself to the server. Traditionally, this
    information was only accessible from the server in the CGI environment variable HTTP_USER_AGENT
    (accessed by $ENV{‘HTTP_USER_AGENT’}). However, JavaScript introduced the userAgent property of
    the navigator object to provide client-side access to the user-agent string:</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var sUserAgent = navigator.userAgent;
        document.write("Your browser details are = " + sUserAgent);
    </script>
</body>
