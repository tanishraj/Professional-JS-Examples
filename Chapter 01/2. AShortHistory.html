    <h2>A Short History</h2>
    <p>Around 1992, a company called Nombas began developing an embedded scripting language
    called C-minus-minus (Cmm for short). The idea behind Cmm was simple: a scripting language
    powerful enough to replace macros, but still similar enough to C (and C++) that developers could learn
    it quickly. This scripting language was packaged in a shareware product called CEnvi, which first
    exposed the power of such languages to developers. Nombas eventually changed the name Cmm to
    ScriptEase because the latter sounded “too negative” and the letter C “frightened people” (http://
    www.nombas.com/us/scripting/history.htm). ScriptEase is now the driving force behind Nombas
    products. When the popularity of Netscape Navigator started peaking, Nombas developed a version of
    CEnvi that could be embedded into Web pages. These early experiments were called Espresso Pages, and
    they represented the first client-side scripting language used on the World Wide Web. Little did Nombas
    know that its ideas would become an important foundation for the Internet.</p>

    <p>Brendan Eich, who worked for Netscape at the time, began developing a scripting language called
    LiveScript for the upcoming release of Netscape Navigator 2.0 in 1995, with the intention of using it both
    in the browser and on the server (where it was to be called LiveWire). Netscape entered into a development
    alliance with Sun Microsystems to complete the implementation of LiveScript in time for release.
    Just before Netscape Navigator 2.0 was officially released, Netscape changed the name to JavaScript in
    order to capitalize on Java as a new Internet buzzword. Netscape’s gamble paid off and JavaScript
    became a must-have from that point on.</p>
