    <h2>Inheritance</h2>
    <p>The easiest way to describe inheritance is through the classic example, geometric shapes.
    There are really two types of shapes: ellipses (which are rounded) and polygons (which have certain number of sides)
    Circle is type of ellipse with one focus; triangles, rectangles and pentagons are types of polygons
    with different number of sides. A square is a type of rectangle with all sides equal. This describes the perfect
    inheritance relationship.</p>

    <p>There are multiple methods of inheritance, which are covered in next examples.</p>
