    <h2>Dragged Item Events</h2>
    <p>When an item is dragged, the following events fire (in this order):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>dragstart</li>
        <li>drag</li>
        <li>dragend</li>
    </ul>

    <p>At the moment you hold a mouse button down and begin to move the mouse, the dragstart event
        fires on the item that is being dragged. By default, this event fires on an image or text selection being
        dragged. The cursor changes to the no-drop symbol (a circle with a line through it) indicating that the
        item cannot be dropped on itself. You can use the ondragstart event handler to run JavaScript code as
        the dragging begins.</p>
