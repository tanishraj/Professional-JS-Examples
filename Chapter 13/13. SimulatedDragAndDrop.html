        <h2>Simulated Drag And Drop</h2>
        <p>Simulated drag and drop has been around since Internet Explorer 4.0 and Netscape Navigator 4.0 introduced
            support for Dynamic HTML. The basic idea is simple: You create an absolutely positioned layer that can
            be moved along with the mouse. In practice, itâ€™s a bit more complicated to get the true dragand- drop
            feel to come across to users.</p>

        <h3>Example:</h3>
        <p>Try moving your mouse around.</p>
        <p><div id="div1"></div> </p>
    </body>
