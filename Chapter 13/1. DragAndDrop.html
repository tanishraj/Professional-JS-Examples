    <h2>Drag and Drop</h2>
    <p>One of the biggest improvements in computer usability was the proliferation of drag-and-drop
        behavior, allowing users to drag something from one spot on the screen and drop it somewhere
        else to either create an action or simply move the item. This paradigm, developed by XEROX, was
        first incorporated into consumer technology in Mac OS 1.0 and since that time has been incorporated
        in most personal computer operating systems (including Windows). When Dynamic HTML
        was first introduced, developers around the world starting experimenting with drag-and-drop
        functionality using JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Drag and drop is a buzzword in usability, so adding this functionality to your Web site or Web
        application can win major points with customers and clients. At present time, you can accomplish
        drag and drop in two ways using JavaScript: system drag and drop and simulated drag and drop.</p>
