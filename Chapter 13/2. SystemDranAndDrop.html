    <h2>System Drag and Drop</h2>
    <p>System drag and drop is what you probably do on a daily basis when using your Windows,
        Macintosh, or other graphical operation system: You drag something from one area of the screen
        and drop it somewhere else. To delete a file, you drag it to the trash (Macintosh) or the recycle bin
        (Windows); to move a file from one folder to another, you just drag the file from where it is and
        drop it into its new home. System drag and drop works because it has help from the operating system
        to complete its task. Currently, only one Web browser on one platform supports system drag
        and drop in Web pages, and that is Internet Explorer on Windows (although Mozilla supports it in
        XUL-based pages).</p>
    <p>A system drag and drop can move in between windows and frames because the drag action is
        handled by the operating system. You can drag an image from a Web browser onto your desktop
        or into another browser. When you drag it onto your desktop, you download the image; when you
        drag it into another browser, the browser displays the image. The communication between the
        browser and the desktop (or other browser) is handled by the operating system.</p>
