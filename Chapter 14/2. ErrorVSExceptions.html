    <h2>Errors Vs Exception</h2>
    <p>When talking about errors in programming, you really have only two categories of primary concern:
        syntax errors and runtime errors.</p>
    <p>Syntax errors, also called parsing errors, occur at compile time for traditional programming languages
        and at interpret time for JavaScript. These errors are a direct result of an unexpected character in the
        code and thus prevent it from being fully compiled/interpreted. For example, the following line causes
        a syntax error because it is missing a closing parenthesis:</p>
    <p>document.write(“test”;</p>
    <p>When a syntax error occurs, the code cannot be executed. In JavaScript, only the code contained within
        the same thread as the syntax error is affected. Code in other threads and other externally referenced
        files still execute appropriately assuming nothing in them depends on the code containing the error.</p>

    <p>Runtime errors, also called exceptions, occur during execution (after compilation/interpretation). In this
        case, the problems are not with the syntax of the code. Rather, an operation attempting to complete is
        illegal in some way. Example:</p>

    <p>window.openMySpecialWindow();</p>

    <p>In the previous code, an attempt is made to access a method of the window object named
        openMySpecialWindow. Syntactically this line is correct, however, no such method exists. This
        causes the browser to return an exception.</p>
