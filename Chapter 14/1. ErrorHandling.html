    <h2>Error Handling</h2>
    <p>Traditionally, JavaScript has been known as a language filled with confusing error messages such
        as Object Expected and Illegal Syntax with nothing more than a line number to identify its origin.
        Debugging such messages was a painful experience at best, which is why the version 4 browsers
        (Internet Explorer 4.0 and Netscape Navigator 4.0) included some basic error-handling functionality.
        Shortly thereafter, an answer came from the ECMA in the form of ECMAScript, third edition.</p>

    <p>This latest edition of ECMAScript added exception handling capabilities modeled after its big
        brother, Java. Using some of the reserved words from the second edition of ECMAScript, the third
        edition implements the try...catch...finally construct as well as the throw operator.</p>
