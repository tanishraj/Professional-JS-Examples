    <h2>Handling Errors</h2>
    <p>Understanding errors is just part of the solution; understanding how to handle those errors is the other
        part. Instead of using multiple if..else statements, JavaScript offers two specific ways to handle
        errors. The Browser Object Model includes the onerror event handler on both the window object and
        on images, whereas ECMAScript defines the try...catch construct, another statement borrowed from
        Java, to deal with exceptions. This section outlines the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.</p>
