    <h2>Error Reporting</h2>
    <p>Because each browser has its own built-in JavaScript interpreter (including its own mechanisms for
        tracking down errors while interpreting), each reports errors in different ways: Some pop up an error
        message; others simply log the message to a JavaScript console. Regardless of the method used, be
        aware of where this data is located on your target browsers. Browsers such as Internet Explorer, Mozilla,
        Safari, and Opera each have their own unique ways of presenting this data. This section guides you to
        the error message information for each of them.</p>
