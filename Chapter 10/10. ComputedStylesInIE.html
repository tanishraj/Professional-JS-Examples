    <h2>Computed styles in IE</h2>
    <p>In addition to the style object of elements and CSS rules is the computed style of an element. The computed
        style is made up of all the style information from inline styles and CSS rules to give a true indication
        of how the element is being represented on the screen. As usual, Internet Explorer and the DOM
        differ in their implementations.</p>
    <p>Microsoft offers a currentStyle object on each element that includes all properties from the element
        background-color object as well the properties from any relevant CSS ruleâ€™s style object. The
        currentStyle object works in the exact same way as the style object, with all the same properties
        and methods. This means that even if a background color is defined in a CSS rule, currentStyle.
        backgroundColor still contains the correct value:</p>

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <div id="div1" class="special"></div>
    <input type="button" value="Get Background Color"
           onclick="getBackgroundColor()" />

    <script type="text/javascript">
        function getBackgroundColor() {
            var oDiv = document.getElementById("div1");
            alert(oDiv.currentStyle.backgroundColor);
        }
    </script>
