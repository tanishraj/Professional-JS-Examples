    <h2>Ranges in DOM</h2>
    <p>To allow an even greater measure of control over a page, you can use something called a range. A range
        can be used to select a section of a document regardless of node boundaries (note that the selection
        occurs behind the scenes and cannot be seen by the user).</p>
    <p>Ranges are helpful when regular DOM manipulation isnâ€™t specific enough to change a document. And
        as usual, there are two different implementations of ranges: one from the DOM and one from Internet
        Explorer.</p>
