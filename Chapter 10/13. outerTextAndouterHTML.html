    <h2>outerText and outerHTML</h2>
    <p>Along with innerText and innerHTML, Internet Explorer 4.0 also introduced outerText and
        outerHTML, which do exactly the same thing as their inner counterparts except that they
        replace the node in question. For example, setting outerText on a div tag removes it and
        replaces it with a text node. Consider the following line of code:</p>

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <div><span id="para">This is an existing paragraph.</span></div>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var oDiv = document.getElementById("para");

        oDiv.outerHTML += "<p>This is a paragraph.</p>";
        oDiv.outerText += "\nThis para is added through the Javascript.";
    </script>
</body>
