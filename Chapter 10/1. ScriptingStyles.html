    <h2>Scripting Styles</h2>
    <p>When Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) were introduced 1996, they completely changed the way
        developers formatted their HTML pages. Instead of using HTML tags such as <font/> and <b/>,
        pages began using CSS to define the appearance of fonts and other items. The natural next step for
        CSS support was to make styles accessible from JavaScript.</p>

    <p>Internet Explorer 4.0 introduced a style object for each element on a page to manage that element’s
        CSS-defined styles. The DOM eventually adopted this approach as a standard way to access an element’s
        style information.</p>

    <div id="content">This is content paragraph inside a div element.</div>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var oDiv = document.getElementById("content");
        oDiv.style.border = "1px solid #f00";
        oDiv.style.padding = "10px 10px 8px";
    </script>
</body>
