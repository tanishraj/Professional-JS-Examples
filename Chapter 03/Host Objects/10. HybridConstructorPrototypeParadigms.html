    <h2>Hybrid Constructor Prototype Paradigms</h2>
    <p>By using both the constructor and prototype paradigms, you can create an object jsut as you would
    when using other programing language. The concept is very simple: Use the constructor paradigms to define all
    non function properties of the object and use the prototype paradigms to define the function properties
    of the object. The result is that functions are created only once, but each object can have its own instance of
    object properties.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        function Car(sColor, iDoors, iMpg) {
            this.color = sColor;
            this.doors = iDoors;
            this.mpg = iMpg;
            this.drivers = ["Tanish","Vikash"];
        }

        Car.prototype.showColor = function(){
            document.write("Color is = " + this.color);
        }

        oCar1 = new Car("Red", 4, 25);
        oCar2 = new Car("Green", 5, 30);

        oCar1.drivers.push("Nick");

        document.write("Driver for Car1 = " + oCar1.drivers.toString());
        document.write("<br/>Driver for Car2 = " + oCar2.drivers.toString());
    </script>
