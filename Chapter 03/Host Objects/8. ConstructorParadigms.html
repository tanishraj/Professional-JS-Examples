    <h2>Constructor Paradigms</h2>
    <p>Creating a constructor is just as easy as defining a factory function, if not easier.
        The first step is selection of the class name, which becomes the name of the constructor.
        Traditionally, this name begins with a capital letter to differentiate it from variable name,
        which typically begins with lowercase letters.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        function Car(sColor, iDoors, iMpg){
            this.color = sColor;
            this.doors = iDoors;
            this.mpg = iMpg;
            this.showColor = function(){
                document.write("<br/>Color is = " + this.color);
            }
        }

        var oCar1 = new Car("Red", 4, 25);
        var oCar2 = new Car("Green", 5, 50);

        oCar1.showColor();
        oCar2.showColor();

    </script>
