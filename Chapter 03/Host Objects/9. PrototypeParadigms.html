    <h2>Prototype Paradigms</h2>
    <p>This paradigm makes use of an object's prototype property, which is considered to be the prototype
    upon which new object of that type are created. Here, an empty constructor is used only to set up the name
    of the class. Then, all properties and methods are assigned directly to the prototype property.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        function Car(){
        }

        Car.prototype.color = "Red";
        Car.prototype.doors = 4;
        Car.prototype.mpg = 25;
        Car.prototype.showColor = function(){
            document.write("<br/>Color is = " + this.color);
        }

        var oCar1 = new Car();
        var oCar2 = new Car();

        //Here for both the cars colors remains same since we have given the static values
        oCar1.showColor();
        oCar2.showColor();
