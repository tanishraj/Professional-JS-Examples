    <h2>Math Object</h2>
    <p>Math Object is the built in object that you wish you had during the high school math classes.
    It knows all the formulas for the most complicated mathematical problems, and it can figure out
    them out for youif you give the numbers to work with.</p>

    <p>The Math object has several properties, consisting mostly of special values in the world of mathematics.</p>
