    <h2>Declaration And Instantiation</h2>
    <p>Objects are created by using 'new' keyword followed by the name of class you
    wish to instantiate.
        <br/>
        Example:
        <br/>var oObject = new Object();
        <br/>var oStringObject = newString();
    </p>

    <p>The first line creates the instance of object and stores it in the variable oObject.
    The second line creates a new instance of String and stores it in the variable oStringObject.
    The parentheses are not required when the constructor does not required arguments, so the
    above two lines can be rewritten as follows...
        <br/>
        Example:
        <br/>var oObject = new Object;
        <br/>var oStringObject = newString;
    </p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        //Creating instance of different classes
        var oObject = new Object();
        var oStringObject = new String();
    </script>
