    <h2>Dereferencing Objects</h2>
    <p>ECMAScript has a garbage collection routine, meaning that you don't have to specifically destroy
    objects in order to free up the memory. When there are no remaining remaining references to an object
    the object is said to be dereferenced.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var oObject = new Object();
        oObject.name = "Tanish";

        document.write("Name is = " + oObject.name);

        oObject = null;
        //Below code gives an error since object is dereferenced
        document.write("<br/>After deferenced Name is = " + oObject.name);
    </script>
