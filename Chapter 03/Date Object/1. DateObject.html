    <h2>Date Object</h2>
    <p>The Date class in ECMAScript is based on earlier versions of java.util.Date from JAVA.
    ECMAScript as well as JAVA, stores the date as a number of milliseconds since 12 AM on january 1, 1970 UTC.
    UTC stand for Universal time code also known as Greenwich mean time, which is the standard time
    upon which all time zones are based.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var d = Date();
        document.write("Date = " + d.toString());
        d = new Date(0);
        document.write("<br/>Date = " + d.toString());
        d = new Date(1000);
        document.write("<br/>Date = " + d.toString());
    </script>
