    <h2>Forms and Data Integrity</h2>
    <p>Form elements were created to address the need for the user to send data back to the server. The
        answer they provided came in the form (no pun intended) of Web forms, using the HTML form,
    input, select, and textarea elements. Using these elements, browsers can render
    text boxes, combo boxes, and other user input controls to allow communication from the client to
    the server.</p>
