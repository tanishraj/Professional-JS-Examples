    <h2>Text box events</h2>
    <p>Both text box types support the previously mentioned form-field blur and focus events along with two
        others: change and select.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>change —</strong> Occurs when the text box loses focus after the user changed the value (does not fire
            if you change the value setting the value property).</li>
        <li><strong>select —</strong> Occurs when one or more characters have been selected, either manually or by
            using the select() method.</li>
    </ul>

    <input type="text" name="textbox1" value="" onchange="alert('Change')" onselect="alert('Select')"/>
