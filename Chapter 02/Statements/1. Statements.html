    <h2>Statements</h2>
    <p>ECMAScript describes several statements. Statements define most of the syntax of ECMAScript
        and, typically, use one or more keyword to accomplish a given task. Statements can be simple,
        such as telling a function to exit, or complicated, such as specifying a number of commands
        to be executed repeatedly.
