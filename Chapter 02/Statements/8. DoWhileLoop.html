    <h2>Do While Loop</h2>
    <p>The do while statement is a post test loop, meaning the evaluation of the escape condition
    is only done after the code inside the loop has been executed. This means that the body of the loop
    is always executed at least once before the expression is evaluated.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var i = 0;

        do{
            document.write(i + "<br/>");
            i++;
        }while(i <= 10);
    </script>
