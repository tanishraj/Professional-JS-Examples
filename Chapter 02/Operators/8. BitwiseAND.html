    <h2>Bitwise AND</h2>
    <p>The bitwise AND operator is indicated by the ampersand (&) and works directly on
    the binary form of numbers. Essentially, bitwise AND lines up the bits in each number
    and then using the following rules, performs an AND operation between the two bits in the
    same position. AND gives true(1) only when both the values are true(1).</p>
