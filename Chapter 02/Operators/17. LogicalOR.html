    <h2>Logical OR</h2>
    <p>The logical OR operator in ECMAScript is the same as in Java, using the double pipe (||).
    Just like Logical AND, if either operand is no a boolean, logical OR will not always return
    a boolean value:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If one operand is an object and one is a boolean, the object is returned.</li>
        <li>If both operands are objects, the first operand is returned.</li>
        <li>if both operands are null, null is returned.</li>
        <li>if either operand is NaN, NaN is returned.</li>
        <li>If either operand is undefined, an error occurs.</li>
    </ul>

        //var bFalse = false;
        //bResult = (bFalse || bUnknown); //Error
        //document.write(bResult);
