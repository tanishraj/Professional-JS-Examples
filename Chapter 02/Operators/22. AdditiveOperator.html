    <h2>Additive Operator</h2>
    <p>The additive operator, add and subtract, are typically the simplest mathematical operators
    in programming languages. In ECMAScript, however, a number of special behaviors are associated with each operator.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var iNum1 = 10;
        var iNum2 = 20;
        document.write("Addition of 10 and 20 = " + (iNum1 + iNum2));
        document.write("<br/>Addition of 10 and 20 = " + iNum1 + iNum2);
