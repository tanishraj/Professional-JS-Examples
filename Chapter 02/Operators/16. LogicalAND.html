    <h2>Logical AND</h2>
    <p>The logical AND operator in ECMAScript is indicated by the double ampersand (&&). Logical AND can be used with any
    type of operand, not just boolean values. When either operand is not a primitive boolean, logical AND does not always
    return a boolean value.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>If the operand is an object and one is boolean, the object is returned.</li>
        <li>If both operands are objects, the second operand is returned.</li>
        <li>If either operand is null, null is returned.</li>
        <li>If either operand is NaN, NaN is returned.</li>
        <li>If either operand is undefined, an error occurs.</li>
    </ul>
