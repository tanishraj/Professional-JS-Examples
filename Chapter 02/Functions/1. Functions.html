    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>Functions are the heart of ECMAScript: a collection of statements that can be run any where
    at anytime. Functions are declared with the keyword function, followed by set of arguments, and finally
    by the code to execute enclosed in braces.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        function fnSayHi(sName, sMessage){
            document.write("Hi, " + sName + "! " + sMessage);
        }

        fnSayHi("Tanish","How you doing?");
    </script>
