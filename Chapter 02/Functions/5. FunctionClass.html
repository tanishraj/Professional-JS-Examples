    <h2>Function Class</h2>
    <p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of ECMAScript is that function are actually
    full-fledged objects. A function class represents each and every function a developer
    defines.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var fnSayHi = function(sName, sMessage){
            document.write("Hi " + sName + "! " + sMessage);
        }

        fnSayHi("Tanish","A very good morning");
    </script>
</body>
