    <h2>Null Type</h2>
    <p>Another type with just one value, the null type, has only the special value null, which is also its literal.
    The value undefined is actually a derivative of the value null, so ECMAScript defines them as equal to each other.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        document.write("[null == undefined ] = " + (null==undefined));

        var a;
        var b = null;
        document.write("<br/>[a == b ] = " + (a==b));
    </script>
