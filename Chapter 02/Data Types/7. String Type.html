    <h2>String Type</h2>
    <p>The string type is unique in that it is only primitive type that does not have
    a definite size. A string can be used to store zero or more unicode characters, represented
    by 16bit integers. String literals are specified by using either double quotes ("") or single
     quotes('').</p>
