    <h2>Reference Data Type</h2>
    <p>Reference types are commonly referred to as "class", which is to say that when you have
    a reference value, you are dealing with an object. Objects are created by using the new operator
    and providing the name of the class to instantiate.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var oDetails = new Object();

        oDetails = {
            name : "Tanish"
        }

        document.write(oDetails.name);
    </script>
