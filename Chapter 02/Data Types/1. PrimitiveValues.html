    <h2>Primitive Data Type</h2>
    <p>Primitive values are simple pieces of data that are stored on the stack,
        which is to say that their value is store directly in the location that
        the variable accesses. Each one of the primitive types takes up a fixed
        amount of space, it can be stored in the small memory area known as stack.

        var test2 = null;
        document.write("<br/>Value of test2 = " + test2);

        var option = true;
        document.write("<br/>Value of option = " + option);

        var value = 10;
        document.write("<br/>Value of value = " + value);
