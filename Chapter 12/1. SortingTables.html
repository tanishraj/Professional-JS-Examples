    <h2>Sorting Tables</h2>
    <p>In most applications, sorting lists and tables is a normal procedure that you might use on a daily
        basis. When you checking your e-mail, you probably have the table set up to sort by descending
        order on the date column, placing the most recent e-mails at the top. It was only a matter of time
        before this paradigm made its way onto the Web.</p>

    <p>Traditionally, sorting on the Web involves a round-trip to the server with the request indicating
        which column should be sorted and in what direction. However, JavaScript enables you to create
        the same functionality on the client. Using JavaScript, itâ€™s possible to use sortable tables and also
        eliminate the need for costly server-side processing.</p>
