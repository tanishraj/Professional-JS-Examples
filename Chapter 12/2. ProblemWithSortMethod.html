    <h2>Problem with sort method</h2>
    <p>“Object Basics,” you were introduced to the Array object and its sort() method.
        You may remember that the sort() method sorts in ascending order by the ASCII character code of
        each item, meaning that numbers are also sorted by their string equivalents:</p>

    <h3>Example:</h3>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        var arr = [3, 32, 2, 5]
        arr.sort();
        alert(arr.toString());
    </script>
</body>
