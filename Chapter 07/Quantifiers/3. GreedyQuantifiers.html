    <h2>Greedy Quantifiers</h2>
    <p>A greedy quantifiers starts by looking at the entire string for a match. If no match is found, it eliminates the last character
    in the string and tries again. If the match is still not found, the last chracter is again discarded and the process repeats
    until a match is found or the string is left with no characters. All the quantifiers discussed to this point have been greedy.</p>
