    <h2>Lookaheads</h2>
    <p>Sometimes you may want to capture a particular group of characters only if they appear before another
    set of characters. Using lookaheads makes this process easy.</p>
    <p>Alookahead is just what it sounds like: It tells the regular expression evaluator to look ahead any number
    of characters without losing its spot. There are both positive and negative lookaheads. Positive lookaheads
    check whether a certain set of characters comes next. Negative lookaheads determine if a certain set of
    characters does not come next.</p>
    <p>A positive lookahead is created by enclosing a pattern between (?= and ). Note that this is not a group,
    even though it uses parentheses.</p>
    <p>A positive lookahead is created by enclosing a pattern between (?! and ). Note that this is not a group,
    even though it uses parentheses.</p>
