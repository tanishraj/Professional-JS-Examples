    <h2>Non-Capturing Groups</h2>
    <p>Groups that create backreferences are called capturing groups. There are also non-capturing groups, which 
    don't create backreferences. In very long regular expressions, storing backreferences slows down the
    matching process. By using non-capturing groups, you can have the same flexibility to match sequences
    of characters without incurring the overhead of storing the results.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var sToMatch = "#123456789";
        var reNumbers = /#(?:\d+)/;
        document.write(reNumbers.test(sToMatch));
        document.write("Hello" + RegExp.$1); //Output will be an empty string
    </script>

    <p>The last line of this example outputs an empty string because the group is specified as non-capturing.
    Because of this, no backreferences can be used with the replace() method, accessed via the RegExp.$x
    variables, or used in the regular expression itself. Look what happens when the following code is run:</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var sToMatch = "#123456789";
        var reNumbers = /#(?:\d+)/;
        document.write(sToMatch.replace(reNumbers, "abcd$1")); //outputs “abcd$1”
    </script>
