    <h2>MutiLine Mode</h2>
    <p>If a string has only
    one line, this is very straightforward. But what if there are multiple lines contained in a string? You
    could use the split() method to separate the string into an array of lines, but then youâ€™d have to match
    the regular expression against each line.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var sToMatch = "First second\nthird fourth\nfifth sixth";
        var reLastWordOnLine = /(\w+)$/gm;
        var arrWords = sToMatch.match(reLastWordOnLine);
        document.write(arrWords);
    </script>
