    <h2>Common Patterns</h2>
    <p>On the Web, regular expressions are most often used to validate user input before sending data back to
    the server. This is, after all, why JavaScript was initially created.</p>
    <p>The patterns most commonly tested for on the Web are the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dates</li>
        <li>Credit Cards</li>
        <li>URLs</li>
        <li>E-mail Addresses</li>
    </ul>
