    <h2>match() Method</h2>
    <p>match() method is almost similar to exec() method, but there is only one difference that exec() method is applies on
    regular expressions where as match() method is applies on exec() method.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var sToMatch = "a bat, a cat, a fAt baT, a faT cat";
        var reAt = /at/;

        //Below line of code will print only the first occurance of the match since we have not defined global sign in pattern
        document.write("All matches found are = " + sToMatch.match(reAt));

        //Below code will print all occurances of matches excluding case sensitive
        reAt = /at/g;
        arrMatches = sToMatch.match(reAt);
        document.write("<br/>All matches found are = " + arrMatches.length);

        //Below code will print all occurances of matches including case sensitive
        reAt = /at/gi;
        arrMatches = sToMatch.match(reAt);
        document.write("<br/>All matches found are = " + arrMatches.length);
