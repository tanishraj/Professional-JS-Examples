    <h2>exec() Method</h2>
    <p>exec() method is similar to test() method. But there is a major difference between test() and exec() is,
    test() method always check for the first occurance and returns true if matches found with the pattern. where as
    exec() method always check for all occurances and return an array containing all matches.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
        var sToMatch = "a bat, a cat, a fAt baT, a faT cat";
        var reAt = /at/;

        //Below line of code will print only the first occurance of the match since we have not defined global sign in pattern
        document.write("All matches found are = " + reAt.exec(sToMatch));

        //Below code will print all occurances of matches
        reAt = /at/gi;
        arrMatches = reAt.exec(sToMatch);
        document.write("<br/>All matches found are = " + arrMatches.length);
    </script>
