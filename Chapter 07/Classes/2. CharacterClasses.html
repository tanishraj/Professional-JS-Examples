    <h2>Character Classes</h2>
    <p>Character classes are groups of characters to test for. By enclosing characters inside a square bracets,
    you are effectively telling th RE to match the first character, the second cahracter, the third character
    or so on.</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
    	//Example of simple class
    	var sToMatch = "a bat, a cat, a fAt baT, a faT cat";
    	var reBatCatRat = /[bcf]at/gi;
    	var arrMatches = sToMatch.match(reBatCatRat);
    	document.write("Matches are (bcf) = " + arrMatches.toString());

    	//Example of simple class by changing the pattern
    	var reBatCatRat = /[bcr]at/gi;
    	var arrMatches = sToMatch.match(reBatCatRat);
    	document.write("<br/>Matches are (bcr) = " + arrMatches.toString());
