    all letters a through m, number 1 to 4, and the new line character. That class look like this...<br/>
    [a-m1-4\n]
    </p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
    	var sToMatch = "A very old man was walking in the street from last 1 or 2 or 5 hours.";
    	var reCombine = /[a-m1-4]/gi;
    	var arrMatches = sToMatch.match(reCombine);

    	document.write("All the matches are = ");
    	for(var temp in arrMatches){
    		document.write("<br/>" + arrMatches[temp]);
