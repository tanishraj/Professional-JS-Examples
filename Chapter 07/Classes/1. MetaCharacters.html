    <h2>Metacharacters</h2>
    <p>In the previous section you discovered that a comma has to be escaped (proceded with a backslash) to be matched correctly. That's
    because the comma is meta character, which is a character that is part of regular expressions syntax.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Here are all regular expressions look like this...<br/>
    ( [ { \ ^ $ | } ] ) ? * + .
    </p>
    <p>Anytime you want to use one of these characters inside the regular expression, they must be escaped.</p>
