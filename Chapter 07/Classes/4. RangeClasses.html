    <h2>Range Classes</h2>
    <p>Suppose that you want to match any alphabet character, but you really dont want to type every letter in the alphabet
    Instead, you can use a range class to specify a range between a-z. The key here is a dash(-), which should be reading as
    through instead of minus(-).</p>

    <p>Note that [a-z] matches only the lower case letters unless the regular expression is set to case sensitive by using 
    the i-option. To match only upper case letters you must use [A-Z].</p>

    <script type="text/javascript">
    	var sToMatch = "num1, num2, num3, num4, num5, num6, num7, num8, num9";
    	var reOneToFour = /num[1-5]/gi;
    	var arrMatches = sToMatch.match(reOneToFour);
    	document.write("All the matches are = ");
    	for(var temp in arrMatches){
    		document.write("<br/>" + arrMatches[temp]);
    	}
    </script>
